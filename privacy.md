This Privacy Policy governs how we (Digital Kittens Ltd) gather, collect, process, store, and work with your personal information when you read, sign up for, log into, and (or) use KittenPost (https://kittenpost.app) and all of it’s subdomains).
This document is a part of KittenPost’s Terms of Use. Access to KittenPost is subject to Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy.

KittenPost and Digital Kittens Ltd comply with GDPR:
* KittenPost uses cookies and 3rd party cookies on the website and in the service. By using the service and continuing using the website, you consent to using the cookies for the purposes described below.
* We won’t email you without your or your representative’s consent.
* We won’t share your data with any data brokers or any companies outside of our service
providers listed below.
* You have the right to download all your data at any time.

## Basic Principles
You don’t transfer any rights to your data (and the social media pages you connect) to KittenPost by using our Service. We don’t assume ownership of your data. We only collect, store, and process data for specific purposes listed below.
KittenPost does not share any of your private (not publicly accessible) metrics to any 3rd parties. I.e. we don’t sell your data to your competitors for any kind of analysis.
KittenPost stores your metrics data, aggregates and anonymizes them to provide industry and niche performance indexes and projections.
  
## What data we collect
KittenPost is a social media scheduling and analytics service. As such, KittenPost uses two sources of your personal information:

1. It asks you to provide some of your personal information when you sign up and use the Service, such as:
* your name and email;
* your current company name;
* your personal or your company payment information, including your credit card
credentials;
* your current timezone and location are detected and stored in our database
using your IP address to improve the service quality, namely collaboration and notification features.

2. KittenPost collects some of your personal information from the social media platforms. When you connect a social media platform to KittenPost, you authorize KittenPost to access your data, such as:
* your social media pages links, IDs, social media handles;
* your social media information: posts, post metrics including reach, views, engagements, likes, comments, video plays, reposts, shares;
* profiles of people who engaged with your content.

## What data we store
All above mentioned data points are stored in our database and associated with your Service user records. We only store the data required to provide the Service, and we never share any of your data with any 3rd party and/or advertising entities.
The data is stored securely in a European datacenter. We rent those servers from Heroku as our hosting partner. Data is backed up to a datacenter in United Kingdom as well — we use DigitalOcean. By using KittenPost, you give us consent to that data transfer.
When using KittenPost, you’ll be prompted to authorize your personal social media profiles on social networks in order to connect your company page to KittenPost. KittenPost only stores the data related to pages you’ve explicitly selected to be connected. When you use your profile authorization to connect a business page, your personal data (except the access token) will not be fetched, used, or stored by KittenPost.

### Specifically, we store:
* your name, email, phone number, company name, and profile data such as a profile image;
* your social media handles, pages, pages data, and personal data. We only store data for the pages you’ve connected to KittenPost;
* KittenPost usage logs: pages you’ve navigated on kittenpost.app, buttons you clicked, posts you created, and when. We use that data to provide you with the best Service and support you along the way;
* all communication with our customer support teams;
* payment data. Once you provided us with your credit card info or your company payment profile (billing address), we store that data and use it to renew your subscription, until you click cancelation button. We don’t store your credit card information, we use Stripe for payment processing. When you cancel, we remove our authorization for recurring payments.

## How we use your data
* working with Social Media on Your behalf;
* payments and communications;
* product research;
* marketing research;

including our database.
* * the team data such as social media data, analytics data, publications plan,
posts drafts will be removed from all our infrastructure;

your account cancelation, and will request that our service providers remove that
data from their servers as well as removing it ourselves after that;

teams, but you’re just removing your profile from KittenPost:
